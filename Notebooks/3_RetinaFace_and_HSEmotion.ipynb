        "# Video and Image Emotion Annotation\n",
        "\n",
        "This script facilitates the detection of faces and annotation of recognized emotions in both videos and images. It utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for face detection and emotion recognition, namely RetinaFace and HSEmotionRecognizer, respectively. The goal is to enhance media content understanding by automatically labeling facial expressions with emotional states.\n",
        "Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Face Detection using RetinaFace:\n",
        "     The detect_faces function leverages the RetinaFace model to identify faces within a given frame of video or image data. It retrieves facial bounding boxes, providing precise coordinates for subsequent processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Emotion Recognition with HSEmotionRecognizer:\n",
        "     The HSEmotionRecognizer model, initialized as recognizer, interprets emotional states from extracted face regions. It predicts emotions based on learned features from the provided face images.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Annotation and Visualization:\n",
        "     The annotate_frame function annotates each detected face with its recognized emotion. It draws bounding boxes around faces and labels them with the predicted emotional state, enhancing visual understanding of the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Processing Pipeline:\n",
        "        Video Processing:\n",
        "        process_video_frames: Iterates through frames of a video, applying face detection and emotion annotation. It saves the processed frames into a temporary video file.\n",
        "        add_audio_to_video: Incorporates audio from the original video back into the processed frames, creating a final annotated video output.\n",
        "        process_video: Integrates frame processing and audio addition into a cohesive function for video processing tasks.\n",
        "        Image Processing:\n",
        "        process_image: Handles single images by detecting faces, annotating emotions, and optionally combining input and annotated images for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Video Processing: Provide paths to video files (*.mp4, *.avi, *.mov, *.mkv) to analyze and annotate facial expressions throughout the video duration.\n",
        "    Image Processing: For static images (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png), the script detects faces, predicts emotions, and optionally displays the original and annotated images side by side.\n"
