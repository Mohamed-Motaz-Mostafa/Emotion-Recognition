# Emotion Recognition Project ðŸ˜Œ

## Overview
This project is the culmination of our efforts in the Computer Vision course at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). Our focus was on Emotion Recognition, and through this journey, we gained a deep understanding of facial detection and emotional recognition.

## Project Description
- Our project involved experimenting with various pre-trained models to identify the best approaches for face detection and emotion recognition. We evaluated the performance of different models and ultimately selected RetinaFace for face detection due to its superior performance.
- We also implement Xception model architecture and train it on the fer2013 dataset for emotion recognition.

## Models Explored
- **OpenCV Haar Cascade**: A widely used method for face detection.
- **MTCNN**: Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks for face detection.
- **RetinaFace**: A highly accurate face detector.
- **DeepFace (VGG16)**: A model for facial recognition and emotion detection.
- **HSEmotion**: A pre-trained model specifically for emotion recognition.
- **Xception**: A deep learning model architecture used for emotion recognition.

## Deployment
Our emotion recognition model is deployed on Hugging Face. You can explore it through the following links:
